# Time Series Segmentation Tool

This software is for segmenting and labelling time series data, specifically EEG data. 

## Requirements

This project requires Python and some external libraries. All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Install Python

Ensure that Python is installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

To avoid conflicts with other projects, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment. Run the following commands:

- **On Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies.

- **On Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

You should now see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries and dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application. For example, if the main file is `app.py`, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

If the app has a different entry point or requires additional configuration, refer to the project documentation for specific instructions.

### 6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)

After you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Additional Information

- If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the project maintainers.
- For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [documentation](link to documentation, if applicable).
